# Tim_graduation_project

Welcome to Karina's Git Graveyard, where code goes to die. Abandoned branches, 
forgotten pull requests, and merge conflicts that were never resolved - they all rest here in peace. 
But don't worry, they're in good company with all the other undead code. 
Join us in paying our respects to these fallen soldiers of programming, and who knows, 
maybe one day they'll rise again...as a different feature branch...
